## What it does

Due to torch being published in many different variants with local versions to signify the underlying API, it is hard to integrate into a lockfile-based workflow. This is due to the local versions - `+cu111`, `+cpu`, and so on - being considered the "same" package, so you can't resolve two at the same time.

This tool generate multiple lockfiles *only for torch* and allows you to use a pdm subcommand (`pdm torch`) to select the one you want.

### Configuration

These are the supported options:

```toml
[tool.pdm.plugins.torch]
dependencies = [
   "torch==1.10.2"
]
lockfile = "torch.lock"
enable-cpu = true

enable-rocm = true
rocm-versions = ["4.2"]

enable-cuda = true
cuda-versions = ["cu111", "cu113"]
```

## Installation

Currently PDM does not support specifying plugin-dependencies in your pyproject.toml. Thus, we suggest using a setup like the following:

``` toml
[tool.pdm.scripts]
post_install = "pdm plugin add pdm-plugin-torch==$VERSION"
```
